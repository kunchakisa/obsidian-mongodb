Example of these commands are `updateOne()`, `findOne()`, and `deleteOne()`.

## When to use

We can use this if we are **sure** that we will only get one result. One example will be querying for a unique field like `_id`. If we use these commands for non-unique fields, we will only get one of the few, or **even** one of the **MANY** results in the database.
