# What is Unix Epoch

The **Unix epoch** (or **Unix time** or **POSIX time** or **Unix timestamp**) is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap seconds. Literally speaking the epoch is Unix time 0 (midnight 1/1/1970), but 'epoch' is often used as a synonym for Unix time.
